    <h1>What the Puck?!&trade;</h1>
    <img src="./assets//puck.png" />
    <h2>What you need to play the game</h2>
    <p>You only need <strong>2</strong> things to play:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A <strong>puck</strong></li>
      <li>A table</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If you have a 3D printer, you can download the
      <a href="./puck/puck.stl" download>offical puck here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>If you have Pucket&trade;, then the pucks are a similar size.</p>
    <p>Failing that, just cut a 13mm piece of a 35mm dowel.</p>
    <h2>Rules</h2>
    <p>Two players either side of a table.</p>

    <p>One player spins the puck towards their opponent.</p>

    <p>The opponent then attempts to catch the puck between their thumbs.</p>

    <p>
      If they are successful, the spinner chooses rugby or football, and creates
      a goal with Thier hands at the edge of the table.
    </p>

    <p>
      They then try and shoot a goal from where they caught the ball, in the
      position their thumns caught it.
    </p>

    <p>The spinner and shooter then swap.</p>

    <p>First to 5 wins.</p>

    <h3>Note - Advantage Rule</h3>
    <p>
      If the spinner spins the puck off the table, the shooter then has
      advantage. The spinner then spins again, but if the catcher misses/drops
      the puck they get another spin to try again.
    </p>

    <h2>Puck Model</h2>

    <p>
      You can create your own puck by editing the OpenSCAD model found
      <a href="./puck/puck.scad" download>here</a>.
