# What the Puck Game

 <img src="./assets//puck.png" />
 
## What you need to play the game

You only need **2** things to play:

- A **puck**
- A table

If you have a 3D printer, you can get the <a href="./puck/puck.stl" download>offical puck here</a>.

If you have Pucket&trade;, then the pucks are a similar size.

Failing that, just cut a 13mm piece of a 35mm dowel.

## Rules

Two players either side of a table.

One player spins the puck towards their opponent.

The opponent then attempts to catch the puck between their thumbs.

If they are successful, the spinner chooses rugby or football, and creates a goal with Thier hands at the edge of the table.

They then try and shoot a goal from where they caught the ball, in the position their thumns caught it.

The spinner and shooter then swap.

First to 5 wins.

### Note - Advantage Rule

If the spinner spins the puck off the table, the shooter then has advantage. The spinner then spins again, but if the catcher misses/drops the puck they get another spin to try again.

## Puck Model

You can create your own puck by editing the OpenSCAD model found <a href="./puck/puck.scad" download>here</a>.
