  <h2>What you need to play the game</h2>
  <p>You only need <strong>2</strong> things to play:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A <strong>puck</strong></li>
    <li>A table</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    If you have a 3D printer, you can download the
    <a href="./puck/puck.stl" download>offical Puck&trade; puck here</a>.
  </p>
  <p>If you have Pucket&trade;, then the pucks are a similar (the exact same) size.</p>
  <p>Failing that, just cut a 13mm piece of a 35mm dowel.</p>
  <h2>Rules</h2>
  <p>Two players either side of a table.</p>
  <p>One player spins the puck towards their opponent.</p>
  <p>The opponent then attempts to catch the puck between their thumbs.</p>
  <p>
    If they are successful in catching with only their thumbs, the opponent creates
    a goal with thier hands at the edge of the table.
  </p>

  <p>
    They then try and shoot a goal from where they caught the ball, without repositioning the puck between their thumbs
    from when they caught it.
  </p>

  <p>The spinner and shooter then swap.</p>

  <p>First to 5 wins.</p>

  <h2>Things of note</h2>
  <h3>Advantage Rule</h3>
  <p>
    If the spinner spins the puck off the table, the shooter then has
    advantage. The spinner then spins again, but if the catcher misses/drops
    the puck they get another spin to try again.
  </p>

  <h3>How to make a goal</h3>
  <img src="./assets/fingergoal.png" class="finger-goal-img" alt="finger goal example" />
  <h3>Dropped the puck before getting to shoot?</h3>
  <p>Tough luck, so long as your opponent created a goal for you right away.</p>


  <h3>Fingers are not thumbs</h3>
  <p>If any other part of your hand touches the puck, its not a catch.</p>

  <h2>Custom Puck&trade;s</h2>
  <p>
    You can create your own puck by editing the OpenSCAD model found
    <a href="./puck/puck.scad" download>here</a>.
