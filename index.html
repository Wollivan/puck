    <h2>What is this?</h2>
    <p>Puck is a game that you can play with any sort of puck, on any sort of table, with any sort of person.</p>
    <p>You only need <strong>2</strong> things to play with your sort of person:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A <strong>puck</strong></li>
      <li>A table</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="rules">
    <h2>Rules</h2>
    <p>Two players either side of a table.</p>
    <p>One player spins the puck on the table between them.</p>
    <p>The opponent attempts to catch the puck between their thumbs with no other part of their hand touching the puck.
    </p>
    <p>
      If they are successful, the spinner creates
      a goal with thier hands at the edge of the table.
    </p>

    <p>
      The player who is precariously holding the puck must try to shoot a goal from the exact position they caught the
      puck (both the location on the table and position between the thumbs cannot be altered before shooting).
    </p>

    <p>Swap. Rinse. Repeat. Puck.</p>

    <p>First to 5 goals wins.</p>

    <p><i>If you're feeling spicy and have great dental care, the shooter can choose rugby or football to have the goal
        either be fingers pointing down, or up. the crossbar (the thumbs) should be in about the same height for both
        types of goal, and for rugby there is no height limit.</i></p>

  <section id="get-a-puck">
    <h2>Get a puck</h2>
    <div class="get-a-puck">
      <p><a href="./puck/puck.stl" download>Download the STL</a> to print your
        own,
        100% infill for best results</p>
      <p>or</p>
      <p> <span id="share" class="pretend-link">Send them to your friend</span> with a 3D printer</p>
      <p>or</p>
      <p>If you have Pucket&trade;, then the pucks are a similar (the exact same) size.</p>
      <p>or</p>
      <p>Failing that, just cut a 13mm piece of a 35mm dowel.</p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section id="things-to-note">
    <h2>Things of note</h2>
    <h3>Advantage Rule</h3>
    <p>
      If the spinner spins the puck off the table, spin it again, but the shooter has
      advantage so if they fail to catch, they get another spin to try again.
    </p>

    <h3>How to make a goal</h3>
    <img src="./assets/fingergoal.png" class="finger-goal-img" alt="finger goal example" />
    <h3>Dropped the puck before getting to shoot?</h3>
    <p>Tough luck, so long as your opponent created a goal for you right away.</p>


    <h3>Fingers are not thumbs</h3>
    <p>If any other part of your hand touches the puck, its not a catch.</p>

    <h2>Custom Puck&trade;s</h2>
    <p>
      You can create your own puck by editing the OpenSCAD model found
      <a href="./puck/puck.scad" download>here</a>.
